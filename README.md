Evaluation of a ViT network implemented with Pytorch based on [lucidrainÂ´s code]([myLib/README.md](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch). 
The original ViT network is described in [2020, An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy)
The ViT implementation is tested with MNIST dataset for numerical digits recognition. With 5 epochs training using batches of 128 images, the network achieves ~92% accuracy in the test set.
